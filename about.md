Right now I'm building [Orchid](https://www.orchidhealth.com).

<br>

Before Orchid, I taught a class at Stanford on [Reproductive Technology](https://reproductivetech.stanford.edu), did AI and genomics research, started a speaker series called [#nofilter](https://nofiltertalks.com/), ran a [translational group](http://ai.stanford.edu/entrepreneurs/index.html) for entrepreneurial researchers in the Stanford AI Lab, and earned my MS/BS in Computer Science from Stanford. Before Stanford, I met some of my favorite people through the [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/) - highly recommend applying if you're under 20!
