Right now I'm doing research under [Anshul Kundaje](https://profiles.stanford.edu/anshul-kundaje) (deep learning for genomics). Past: researcher under [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun) (skin classifiers).

While at Stanford, I studied Computer Science, started a talk series called [#nofilter](https://nofiltertalks.com/), ran a translational [group](http://ai.stanford.edu/entrepreneurs/index.html) for researchers in the Stanford AI Lab,  cofounded Stanford's [Center for Distributed Trust](https://cryptolab.stanford.edu/about), and taught a [class](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bioe60/) on distributed technologies.

Before Stanford, I started a digital health company called Remedy, that helped doctors get instant answers from specialists. We deployed our product to doctors and nurses at Harvard affiliated hospitals. I met some of my favorite people through the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/").
